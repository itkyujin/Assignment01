Question: Why did you select this particular Topic?
Answer: 
I usually like to collect interesting movies and organize various materials related to those movies in one place.
Especially when you spend a lot of time at home due to Corona,
I think it is very useful to utilize an application that allows you to search for popular movies.
The Cannes Film Festival in Germany is now attracting attention around the world.
I chose this topic because I wanted to make an application through Node JS 
that allows many people to freely register, edit, and share their favorite movies through the topic I selected.
